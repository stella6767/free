## Backend

### Spring Boot 

In my experience, Spring Boot is the most well-rounded framework for server-side development. Other frameworks have their strengths and weaknesses, but Spring Boot is the one that checks all the boxes to a certain degree.

### JPA

I've used several ORMs in different environments, but the combination of Hibernate and JPA feels like the most optimal option I've experienced. I'm completely happy with it and wouldn't want to choose any other ORM for relational DBs.

### Kotlin JDSL

As far as I know queryDsl is Best Type Safe Query Builder in JVM environment. But compile process is kind of complicated. Kotlin JDSL is pretty solid Alternatives for querydsl. there is no separate compilation process. I believe that queryDsl still the best option. but kotlin jdsl is a also pretty good choice.
